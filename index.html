      Cassidy is the Head of Developer Voice Programs at Amazon.
      She's worked for L4 Digital, Clarifai, Venmo, Intuit, Microsoft, and General Mills,
      and graduated with a computer science degree from Iowa State University in
      2014. She's had the honor of working with various organizations, including
      Hacker Fund as their Director of Outreach. She's active in the developer
      community and one of Glamour Magazine's 35 Women Under 35 Changing the Tech
      Industry and LinkedIn's Top Professionals 35 &amp; Under. As an avid speaker,
      Cassidy has participated in meetups and events including the Grace Hopper

      Engineering Festival.  She wants to inspire generations of STEM students
      to be the best they can be, and her favorite quote is from Helen Keller:
      "One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar."  She
      loves mechanical keyboards and karaoke.

    Thanks for reading this far. In exchange for your seemingly undying
